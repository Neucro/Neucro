### Hello there I am Sajid! ðŸ‘‹


I am a curious guy who has desire for tech and research. Trying to learn something each day. I love to code and build things. My current focus is to work with AI/ML/DL. At present actively looking for opportunities to collab in research and development related to data.


In short: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal projects related to business analytics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn more about data science.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on AI/ML/DL Projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with jobs.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about giving me opportunities.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mail me.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think cooking is more like coding.
